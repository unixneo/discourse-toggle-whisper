# discourse-toggle-whisper

This theme component adds a post menu button for staff users to make a regular post a whisper or vice versa for all users (only only staff posts).

This is useful especially for forums where a lot of conversations happen in whisper and a staff user ends up posting something and later wants to hide or show the post to non-staff users.

We use this at our forum to hide posts (answers) when a moderator has asked a question and the OP has not yet answered the moderator's question(s).   

The "before we forked it" version did not permit staff to hide (toggle-whisper) the posts of non-staff posters.  This change reverts the last change by @pavilliondev and makes it possible for staff to toggle-whisper all posts (staff or not).
